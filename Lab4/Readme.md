# Laba4
**The work was performed by Andrii Protsenko.**

 **Variant 18**

In this laboratory work, we wrote code to calculate three expressions.

**Resalts:**

- Task18: (for i0 = -6, i1 = -3, i2 = 2); Minimum absolute value in the array: 2;
- Task48: (for i0 = 2, i1 = 1, i2 = 2, i3 = 3, i4 = 4, i5 = 8); Geometric mean of even elements with indices multiple of 5: 4.0;
- Task64: (for i0 = -4, i1 = 3, i2 = 0); Modified Array: 4 0 -2.
