# Laba3
**The work was performed by Andrii Protsenko.**

 **Variant 18**

In this laboratory work, we wrote code to calculate three expressions.

**Resalts:**

- Task3: (for z = 3, k = 13) = 11.118810992072936; (for z = 3, k = 15) = 8.142150073783535; (for z = 3, k = 16) = Warning value k >=15;
- Task6: (for t = 2, i = 1) = 1.4142135623730951; (for t = 2, i = 2) = 0.7071067811865475; (for t = 2, i = 4) = 20.0;
- Task14: (for E = 2.0-E5) = 0.4323360590027257; (for E = 0) = E must be greater than 0.
